# GVRf Leap Motion Library

This is a very early version of the integration library using GVRf and LeapMotion that 
makes use of the leapC library. 

The input from the sensor is used to control the stock rigged hand model
provided by Leap Motion. The library uses a custom skeletal controller class 
"SkeletalController.java" to manipulate the hand model. The class is a 
placeholder till a full featured GVRf Skeletal framework is added to the core
framework, this class will be replaced by the GVRf Skeletal framework when ready.

## Note that this library is still under development and is bound to change in the future.
